# Nothing to See Here

A minimalist, animated "404-like" webpage built with HTML and CSS, featuring a typing animation with a glowing gradient text effect. The page uses the Space Mono font and is fully responsive for various screen sizes.

## Features

- **Typing Animation**: Simulates a typing effect for the message "Sorry, nothing is here!" with a blinking cursor.
- **Gradient Text Effect**: Applies a smooth gradient transition to the text using CSS background clipping.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) using media queries and `clamp` for fluid typography.
- **Custom Styling**: Uses CSS custom properties (variables) for easy theme adjustments.
- **Google Fonts**: Integrates the Space Mono font for a modern, monospaced aesthetic.

## Demo

You can view the live demo by opening `index.html` in a web browser or hosting it on a static server.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iamrashedhasan/nothing.github.io.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd nothing.github.io
   ```

3. **Open the Page**:
   Open `index.html` in a web browser directly, or use a local server (e.g., with VS Code's Live Server extension or a simple HTTP server).

## Usage

- The page is self-contained in `index.html` and requires no additional dependencies beyond an internet connection to load the Google Fonts stylesheet.
- Customize the colors by modifying the CSS custom properties in the `:root` selector (e.g., `--bg-color`, `--gradient-color-1`, `--gradient-color-2`, `--cursor-color`).
- Adjust the message by editing the `<h1 class="message">` content in `index.html`.
